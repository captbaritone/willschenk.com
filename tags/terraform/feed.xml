This will show how to use Terraform to manage the configuration and how we can access both cloud and kubernetes managed services from OpenFaaS functions. We are going to use the digitalocean, kubernetes, and helm terraform providers. The plan Provision a digitalocean_kubernetes_cluster Provision a digitalocean_database_cluster Provision 2 kubernetes_namespace for openfaas and openfaas-fn Provision a helm_release for openfaas Provision a helm_release for redis Provision 2 kubernetes_secret to point to the databases Deploy an OpenFaaS function that reads those secrets and talks to the database.</description></item><item><title>Template to setup a linode server with DNS and HTTPS</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/server_templating_with_terraform/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/server_templating_with_terraform/</guid><description>I use DNSimple for domain management, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with a bunch of different cloud providers and deployment setups. So I wanted to make it easier to give these machines names rather than clicking through the control panel all the time. Lets walk through how to use terraform, DNSimple, and linode to provision and new machine and give it a name on the internet, and then create a webserver on it to which encrypts traffic.</description></item><item><title>Terraform and Packer with Digital Ocean</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/terraform_with_digitalocean/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/terraform_with_digitalocean/</guid><description>Terraform orchastrates the setting up of your infrastructure, and packer helps you build images. We are going to setup terraform to work with Digital Ocean, and then use package to create and image and deploy it.
Install terraform Install terraform from the download page. I&amp;rsquo;m on Linux, so we&amp;rsquo;ll download the latest version and put it in /usr/local/bin.
cd /tmp wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.18/terraform_0.12.18_linux_amd64.zip unzip terraform_0.12.18_linux_amd64.zip sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin Setup Digital Ocean API We need two tokens.</description></item></channel></rss>
