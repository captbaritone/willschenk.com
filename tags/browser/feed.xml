When do we actually need to have a multi-process solution for a website? How much can we really do within a single process? One type of architecture I&amp;#39;m exploring is to have a zillion little sqlite files that are shipped around as needed, rather than providing an API to parse them out have one way where we can generate a bunch of effectively static assets of the structured data and then having the visualization happen on the client side.</description></item></channel></rss>
