Here&amp;#39;s a way to easily setup a man in the middle proxy to look at all the traffic your application is generating. Run the docker instance First we first up the proxy with the web interface: docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 mitmproxy/mitmproxy mitmweb --web-host 0.</description></item><item><title>rails uuid primary key</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/rails_uuid_primary_keys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/rails_uuid_primary_keys/</guid><description>Exposing primary keys externally just sort of invites people to poke around in your system. Lets configure rails to use uuid instead. Create a postgres rails app We are going to be relying upon the pgcrypto postgres extension, so lets go ahead a create a postgres based rails application. rails new testapp -d=postgresql cd testapp Now we tell our generators that we want our primary key type to be :uuid: # config/initializers/generators.</description></item><item><title>Tailwind and Rails</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/tailwind_and_rails/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/tailwind_and_rails/</guid><description>Tailwind is a really nice set of CSS utility classes that let you style up a page staying largely in one file at a time. Rails has it&amp;#39;s own wild way of dealing with javascript, so lets go through how to make them play well together.

Looking at the readme is helpful, and projects that keep a changelog are polite and friendly, but it&amp;#39;s nice to actually get down to it and see what the changes actually are. Loading the repo and finding the tags We first need to look at where the code is from. In looking at gemfiles we found how to see what gem you are currently working with, and in looking and package.</description></item><item><title>Looking at package.json</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/looking_at_packagejson/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/looking_at_packagejson/</guid><description>Look at the dependencies First lets create a simple project and add a single module, in this case npm-api which will we use to access the main repository. npm init -y npm add npm-api And lets see what&amp;#39;s been installed in node_modules: ls -l node_modules | wc -l du -sh node_modules 68 12M node_modules 68 directories with 12M of code!</description></item><item><title>Looking at Gemfiles</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/looking_at_gemfiles/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/looking_at_gemfiles/</guid><description>Bundler is the standard way for Ruby projects to specifiy dependencies.

However it currently doesn&amp;#39;t support looking at the files inside of the commit itself – it gives you a view of the repository at the time of the commit, but not the patch itself. Since I don&amp;#39;t know enough about golang and sqlite virtual tables, let&amp;#39;s just create a sqlite3 database from the logfile. Get the gitlog We are going to use our favorite test repo, ruby-git because it&amp;#39;s so deliciously meta.</description></item><item><title>Using Askgit</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/using_askgit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/using_askgit/</guid><description>askgit provides a sql interface to your git repository. Let&amp;#39;s install it and see what we can figure out about the repo. Installing Following the instructions on the website, we can build the go binary with: go get -v -tags=sqlite_vtable github.com/augmentable-dev/askgit This will download the package, the dependencies, and compile everything into an executable. If you can&amp;#39;t figure out where it&amp;#39;s installed, check that you have GOPATH set correctly, and it will end up in $GOPATH/bin.</description></item><item><title>Getting Websters</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/getting_websters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/getting_websters/</guid><description>A few years ago I read a great post about the value of a good dictionary, which I installed on my laptop and then promptly forgot about.

This was fun – a world wide network all built up by volunteers sharing. Since we are all carrying supercomputers around now with massive idle storage and bandwidth, let&amp;#39;s think about how we can recreate some of that fun, independent data sharing with modern web technologies, specifically Websockets and WebRTC.

Running npx live-server is an easy one liner to spin up a server, that opens a browser for you and also updates changes on safe. Sometimes that&amp;#39;s not enough. Often you want to pull in data from an API, and that requires HTTPS, and also you need to work around CORS limitations.</description></item><item><title>Beginning Emacs</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/beginning_emacs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/beginning_emacs/</guid><description>Intro I&amp;#39;ve been dipping back ito the world of free software, and have been having a huge amount of fun getting back into emacs.

It&amp;rsquo;s a peer to peer distributed file system, or graph database, where you reference the data by its hash. This has the great property that the data is no longer tied to a particular computer or server. It can be spread around and you can get it from anybody without worrying if they&amp;rsquo;ve changed or alterted it in any way. If you know what you are looking for, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about who you get it from.</description></item><item><title>Playing with deno</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/deno/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/deno/</guid><description>Deno is a new V8 based TypeScript and JavaScript programming language that works like a command line web browser. It was written by the creaters of NodeJS and seeks to fix some of the issues with Node around it&amp;rsquo;s security model and pacakge management.

I wanted to find a way to easily create links to these product pages, and show images if needed. There&amp;rsquo;s no API to access bookshop (I asked on our internal dev channel) but I know how to write a script so I cobbled something together and made a hugo shortcode to render stuff on my blog.</description></item><item><title>Styling tables with Hugo</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/styling_tables_with_hugo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/styling_tables_with_hugo/</guid><description>Markdown is a nice format to write it, but sometimes you need to add HTML classes directly to the output to make it look how you want. Here&amp;rsquo;s a way to do that using hugo shortcodes.

It&amp;rsquo;s a very different sort of thing than a code text editor like Vim or an IDE like VSCode. It&amp;rsquo;s a different way of thinking of how to interact with a computer, where you build up techniques on top of simple tricks that let you get amazing things done. Of course, part of the appeal/challenge is that you need to figure out how to make it work yourself.</description></item><item><title>Making charts with VueJS and no tooling</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/making_charts_with_vuejs_and_no_tooling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/making_charts_with_vuejs_and_no_tooling/</guid><description>I learned most of what I know about coding by looking at source code &amp;ndash; especially view source on a web browser. Lets see if we can bring that era back a bit by using ES modules and eschewing webpack and other bundling systems. We will use the amazing unpkg.com CDN to get our building blocks to assemble together.
First get vue working From unpkg we will link to tailwindcss in the head tag, and then import vuejs from using a script type=&amp;quot;module&amp;quot; tag.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging disposability for exploration</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/leveraging_disposability_for_exploration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/leveraging_disposability_for_exploration/</guid><description>I play around with a lot of technology to see what&amp;rsquo;s out there and keep myself current, especially trying to find simpler ways to do our work.

It&amp;rsquo;s fully distributed over the dat protocol. When you create a new chat area &amp;ndash; something like a Slack &amp;ndash; it allows anyone with the same key to post and view messages everywhere. When you post a message, everyone gets it and shares it with everyone else, so even when your computer drops off there will still be a coherent view of the data.</description></item><item><title>Splitting Git Repos and Work Directories</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/splitting_git_repos_and_workdirectories/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/splitting_git_repos_and_workdirectories/</guid><description>I found a tutorial on how to manage your dotfiles, that works by splitting up the git repository (normally the .git directory) from the work directory.

There are three main ways to extend middleman. You can add helpers, add middleman commands, or extend the sitemap generation in someway. Lets go through those in detail.
Creating the extension Create a gem using bundle gem _name_
$ bundle gem middleman-graphviz Add middleman-core to your gem dependancies in the .gemspec file:
spec.add_runtime_dependency &amp;#39;middleman-core&amp;#39;, [&amp;#39;&amp;gt;= 3.0.0&amp;#39;] Register your extension into middleman. Our gem will be activated in the sites config.</description></item><item><title>Middleman Tricks and Hacks</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/middleman-tricks-and-hacks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/middleman-tricks-and-hacks/</guid><description>As part of the process of getting this site to work, I learned some more things about how to better build a site with middleman. Building off of our foundational article here are a few other things that I found very useful when using middleman to build a static site with a bunch of dynamically generated content.
Partials The index.html.haml, articles.html.haml, tag.html.haml and calendar.html.haml pages all use the same partial to list out the post archives, which are mostly the same.</description></item><item><title>Dateslice: Writing rails extensions</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/dateslice-writing-rails-extensions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/dateslice-writing-rails-extensions/</guid><description>Ruby on Rails is a very modular framework since the merging with Merb in 2008. The opinionated conventions are implemented under using techniques that let you jump in and build your own components, picking and choosing different parts that let you build Rails apps in the same straightforward way you would if using the official modules.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the dateslices gem which I wrote to extend active record so that we could better interact with the group by sql command when dealing with dates.</description></item><item><title>Pulling data out of Google Analytics</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/pulling-data-out-of-google-analytics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/pulling-data-out-of-google-analytics/</guid><description>I like staring at the real time stats of Google Analytics. As a dashboard, it&amp;rsquo;s not really as amazing as Chartbeat is, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you drill down into the data as much as Mixpanel. But GA is super simple to setup and it&amp;rsquo;s Google, so everyone uses it.
Another obsessive/fun thing to do is to see where that spike in inbound traffic is coming from.

HappySeed is a set of application templates to help you get started building out new sites. The main section is a rails application template plus a set of rails generators to help you get started with rails appliations quickly. These generators setup the configuration of the application in a standard way, and the full set of generators include many things for setting up a modern rails app and well as middleman apps.</description></item><item><title>Building Sites with Middleman</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/building-sites-with-middleman/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/building-sites-with-middleman/</guid><description>I make a lot of websites, and I have a certain toolkit that I use to build them. The most useful things I use are:
layouts and partials so I only need to set things up once haml for writing html, since I don&amp;rsquo;t like closing tags Bootstrap and sass for writing css Markdown for formatting large blogs of content coffeescript for JavaScript Middleman is a static site generator, which means that it takes a bunch of source files, does some stuff with it, and produces static HTML, CSS, Images, and Javascript that can be hosted on a basic server somewhere, including hosting on S3 or Github Pages so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to consider a server.</description></item><item><title>Scripting Twitter: Collecting Data and Writing Bots</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/scripting-twitter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/scripting-twitter/</guid><description>Lets build on our command line url exploring tool to look at how we can interact with Twitter. We are going to cover how to make a script that will pull information out of twitter, how to deal with its rate limiting, and how to interact with users on Twitter itself.
Twitter uses OAuth 1.0A as a way to authenticate requests. As a script writer, this is super annoying, because you can&amp;rsquo;t just stick a username and password in the environment and go from there.</description></item><item><title>Embedding 3d models on your page</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/embedding-3d-models-on-your-page/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/embedding-3d-models-on-your-page/</guid><description>Github has an embeddable 3d model viewer that you can use to display a model on your site.

Pretty fun right?

The anxiety of Y2K rose and crested, and the messianic aura of agents was washed away by more centralized and effective solutions.
The aspirational residue did yield some nuggets, and the idea has found partial success in the form of the bot.</description></item><item><title>Making a command line utility with gems and thor</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/making-a-command-line-utility-with-gems-and-thor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/making-a-command-line-utility-with-gems-and-thor/</guid><description>Some scripts work well because they are self contained and don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of dependancies, like the hosts on your network tracker.

A man whose normal life is starting to fall apart. He&amp;rsquo;s got the wife, family, mortgage and it&amp;rsquo;s both not enough and slipping away. He needs to do something, something to make him feel alive. And since it was that era of Hollywood film making, he&amp;rsquo;s also got plenty of daddy issues he&amp;rsquo;s working through. He becomes seized by a vision, caught in the grip of an idée fixe that he needs to go build something that everyone around him thinks is preposterous.</description></item><item><title>Bootstrap: Advanced Grid Tricks</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/bootstrap-advanced-grid-tricks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/bootstrap-advanced-grid-tricks/</guid><description>We are a big fan of Bootstrap here at HappyFunCorp. While there are some arguments to be made if Bootstrap in particular is all that, or if Foundation is better for a given thing, its clear that starting with some sort of CSS framework is smarter than trying to roll everything yourself.

There are three major complaints with using bootstrap.
All of the sites look the same. There are so many classes in the HTML where they don&amp;rsquo;t strictly belong It&amp;rsquo;s a whole bunch of stuff that you don&amp;rsquo;t need.</description></item><item><title>How to track your coworkers</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/how-to-track-your-coworkers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/how-to-track-your-coworkers/</guid><description>How much information do you bleed?
Ever wonder who is else is using your network? Or,who has actually showed up at the office?
Networking primer The simplest thing we can do to make this work is to check to see which devices have registered themselves on the network. As devices come and go, they connect automatically, so we will have a pretty good idea if people are there or not. Phones seem to attach and detach quite frequency, probably to conserve battery, so if we are want to answer the question &amp;ldquo;is so-and-so in the office&amp;rdquo; we&amp;rsquo;ll need to add additional logic to determine how far spaced the &amp;ldquo;sighting&amp;rdquo; events are to mean that the person has left the office, rather than the phone has gone to sleep.</description></item></channel></rss>
